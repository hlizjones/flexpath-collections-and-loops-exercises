### Summary of JavaScript Concepts Covered in These Exercises

1. **Data Collections**:
    
    - Arrays: Creating, accessing, and manipulating arrays, using methods like `push`, `unshift`, `splice`, and `includes`.
    - Maps: Creating maps with the `Map` constructor, setting and getting values, and handling unique keys, including non-string keys.
    - Sets: Creating sets with the `Set` constructor, adding unique values, and using methods like `has` and `delete`.
2. **Looping Constructs**:
    
    - **While Loop**: Usage and potential pitfalls, like infinite loops.
    - **Do-While Loop**: How it differs from the while loop and when to use it.
    - **For Loop**: Structure and usage for iterating over arrays.
    - **For-Of Loop**: Simplifying iteration over array elements.
    - **For-In Loop**: Iterating over object properties.
    - **Loop Control**: Using `break` and `continue` for controlling loop flow, and understanding labeled statements for nested loops.
3. **Memory Management**:
    
    - Handling primitives and objects in memory.
    - Understanding reference types and how JavaScript manages collections.
